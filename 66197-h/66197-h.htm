<h3>BACON'S ESSAYS, BY MARKBY.</h3>

<p class="center">(<i>Continued from</i> Vol. viii., p. 144.)</p>

<p class="essay">Essay XXIX. Of the true Greatness of Kingdoms.&mdash;</p>

<p>"The speech of Themistocles."] See Plut.
<i>Them.</i> 2., <i>Cimon</i>, 9.</p>

<p>"Negotiis pares."] An expression of Tacitus.
In <i>Ann.</i> vi. 39., he says of Poppæus Sabinus:
"Maximis provinciis per quatuor et viginti annos
impositus; nullam ob eximiam artem, sed quod
<i>par negotiis</i> neque supra erat." Again, in <i>Ann.</i> xvi.
18. of C. Petronius: "Proconsul Bithyniæ, et mox
consul, vigentem se ac <i>parem negotiis</i> ostendit."</p>

<p>"As Virgil saith, 'It never troubles the wolf
how many the sheep be.'"] Lord Bacon, as Mr.
Markby observes, evidently alludes to the following
verses of Eclogue vii.:</p>

<div class="poem">
  <div class="stanza">
    <p>"Hic tantum Boreæ curamus frigora, quantum</p>
    <p>Aut numerum lupus, aut torrentia flumina ripas."</p>
  </div>
</div>

<p>The meaning is, however, doubtless correctly explained
by Heyne: "Ut numerato pecori parcat."
"Quia solam considerat lupus prædam," says Servius.
The sense of the passage is, that after the
shepherd has "told his tale," after he has counted
his sheep, the wolf does not care how much he deranges
the reckoning.</p>

<p>For the advice of Parmenio to attack Darius by
night, and the refusal of Alexander to steal the
victory, see Arrian, <i>Exp. Alex.</i> iii. 10.; Plut.
<i>Alex.</i> 31., <i>Curt.</i> iv. 13.</p>

<p>"Neither is money the sinews of war, as it is
trivially said."] "Nervi belli, pecunia infinita,"
Cic. <i>Phil.</i> v. 2. Machiavel, like Bacon, questions
the truth of this dictum, <i>Disc.</i> ii. 10.</p>

<p>"Solon said well to Crœsus (when in ostentation
he showed him his gold), 'Sir, if any other come
that hath better iron than you, he will be master
of all this gold.'"] This saying is not in Herodotus,
or in Plutarch's Life of Solon. Query, In what
ancient author is it to be found?</p>

<p>"Even as you may see in coppice-woods; if
you leave your staddles too thick, you shall never
have clean underwood, but shrubs and bushes."]
The same illustration is used by Lord Bacon, in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_166"></a>{166}</span>
his <i>History of Henry VII.</i>: "Like to coppice-woods,
that, if you leave in them staddles too
thick, they will run to bushes and briars, and
have little clean underwood" (vol. iii. p. 236., ed.
Montagu). The word <i>staddle</i> means an uncut tree
in a coppice, left to grow. Thus Tusser says,
"Leave growing for staddles the likest and best."
See Richardson in v., and Nares' <i>Glossary</i> in
<i>Staddle</i>, where other meanings of the word are
explained.</p>

<p>"The device of King Henry VII."] See Lord
Bacon's <i>History</i>, ib. p. 234.</p>

<p>"Nay, it seemeth at this instant they [the
Spaniards] are sensible of this want of natives;
as by the Pragmatical Sanction, now published,
appeareth."] To what law does Lord Bacon allude?</p>

<p>"Romulus, after his death (as they report or
feign), sent a present to the Romans, that above
all they should intend arms, and then they should
prove the greatest empire of the world."] See
Livy, i. 16., where Romulus is described as giving
this message to Proculus Julius. A similar message
is reported in Plut. <i>Rom.</i> 28.</p>

<p>"No man can by caretaking (as the Scripture
saith) add a cubit to his stature."] See Matt. vi.
27.</p>

<p class="essay">Essay XXX. Of Regimen of Health.&mdash;See
<i>Antith.</i>, No. 4. vol. viii. p. 355.</p>

<p class="essay">Essay XXXI. Of Suspicion.&mdash;See <i>Antith.</i>,
No. 45. vol. viii. p. 377.</p>

<p class="essay">Essay XXXII. Of Discourse.&mdash;</p>

<p>"I knew two noblemen of the west part of
England," &amp;c.] Query, Who are the noblemen
referred to?</p>

<p class="essay">Essay XXXIII. Of Plantations.&mdash;</p>

<p>"When the world was young it begat more
children; but now it is old it begets fewer."]
This idea is taken from the ancients. Thus Lucretius:</p>

<div class="poem">
  <div class="stanza">
    <p>"Sed quia finem aliquam pariendi debet habere,</p>
    <p>Destitit, ut mulier spatio defessa vetusto."</p>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <p class="i8">V. 823-4.</p>
  </div>
</div>

<p>"Consider likewise, what commodities the soil
where the plantation is doth naturally yield, that
they may some way help to defray the charge
of the plantation; so it be not, as was said, to the
untimely prejudice of the main business, <i>as it hath
fared with tobacco in Virginia</i>."] On the excessive
cultivation of tobacco by the early colonists of
Virginia, see Grahame's <i>History of North America</i>,
vol. i. p. 67. King James's objection to tobacco
is well known.</p>

<p>"But <i>moil</i> not too much underground."] This
old word, for <i>to toil, to labour</i>, has now become
provincial.</p>

<p>"In <i>marish</i> and unwholesome grounds."] <i>Marish</i>
is here used in its original sense, as the adjective of
<i>mere</i>. Spenser and Milton use it as a substantive;
whence the word <i>marsh</i>.</p>

<p>"It is the guiltiness of blood of many <i>commiserable</i>
persons."] No instance of the word
<i>commiserable</i> is cited in the Dictionaries from any
other writer than Bacon.</p>

<p class="essay">Essay XXXIV. Of Riches.&mdash;See <i>Antith.</i>, No. 6.
vol. viii. p. 356.</p>

<p>"In sudore vultûs alieni."] Gen. iii. 19.</p>

<p>"The fortune in being the first in an invention,
or in a privilege, doth cause sometimes a
wonderful overgrowth in riches, <i>as it was with the
first sugar-man in the Canaries</i>."] When was the
growth of sugar introduced into the Canaries?
To what does Bacon allude? It does not appear
that sugar is now grown in these islands; at least
it is enumerated among their imports, and not
among their exports.</p>

<p class="essay">Essay XXXV. Of Prophecies.&mdash;</p>

<p>"Henry VI. of England said of Henry VII.,
when he was a lad and gave him water, 'This is
the lad that shall enjoy the crown for which we
strive.'"] Query, Is this speech reported by any
earlier writer?</p>

<p>"When I was in France I heard from one Dr.
Pena, that the queen-mother, who was given to
curious arts, caused the king her husband's nativity
to be calculated under a false name, and
the astrologer gave a judgment that he should be
killed in a duel; at which the queen laughed,
thinking her husband to be above challenges and
duels; but he was slain upon a course at tilt, the
splinters of the staff of Montgomery going in at his
beaver."] The king here alluded to is Henri II.,
who was killed at a tournament in 1559; his queen
was Catherine de Medici. Bacon's visit to France
was in 1576-9 (<i>Life</i>, by Montagu, p. xvi.), during
the reign of Henri III., when Catherine of
Medici was queen-mother. Query, Is this prophecy
mentioned in any French writer?</p>

<p>"Octogesimus octavus mirabilis annus." Concerning
the prophecy which contained this verse,
see Bayle, <i>Dict.</i>, art. <i>Stofler</i>, note <span class="allsmcap">E</span>: art. <i>Bruschius</i>,
note <span class="allsmcap">E</span>.</p>

<p class="essay">Essay XXXVII. Of Masques and Triumphs.&mdash;</p>

<p>"The colours that show best by candlelight are
white, carnation, and a kind of sea-water green;
and <i>oes</i>, or spangs, as they are of no great cost, so
they are of most glory." Mr. Markby says that
Montagu and Spiers take the liberty of altering
the word <i>oes</i> to <i>ouches</i>. Halliwell, in his <i>Dictionary</i>,
explains <i>oes</i> to mean <i>eyes</i>, citing one
manuscript example. This would agree tolerably
with the sense of the passage before us. <i>Ouches</i>
would mean <i>jewels</i>.</p>

<p class="essay">Essay XXXVIII. Of Nature in Men.&mdash;See
<i>Antith.</i>, No. 10. vol. viii. p. 459.</p>

<p>"Optimus ille <i>animi</i> vindex," &amp;c.] "Ille <i>fuit</i>
vindex" in Ovid.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_167"></a>{167}</span></p>

<p>"Like as it was with Æsop's damsel, turned
from a cat to a woman."] See Babrius, Fab. 32.</p>

<p>"Otherwise they may say, 'Multum incola fuit
anima mea.'" Whence are these words borrowed?</p>

<p class="essay">Essay XXXIX. Of Custom and Education.&mdash;See
<i>Antith.</i>, No. 10. vol. viii. p. 359.</p>

<p>"Only superstition is now so well advanced, that
men of the first blood are as firm as butchers by
occupation, and votary resolution is made equipollent
to custom, even in matter of blood."] This

<h3>BISHOP BURNET, H. WHARTON, AND SMITH.</h3>

<p>The following curious piece of literary history
is quoted from pp. 145-147. of Smith's <i>De Re
Nummaria</i>:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"But having thus owned the bishop's generosity, I
must next inform the reader what occasion I have to
make some complaint of hard usage, partly to myself,
but infinitely more to Dr. H. Wharton, and that after
his decease also. The matter of fact lies in this order.
After Ant. Harmer had published his <i>Specimen of
Errors</i> to be found in the Bishop's <i>History of the Reformation</i>,
there was a person that frequented the
coffee-house where we met daily at Oxon, and who<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_168"></a>{168}</span>
afterwards became a prelate in Scotland, that was continually
running down that History for the errors discovered
in it, many of which are not very material, and
might in so large a work have been easily pardoned;
and in order to obtain such a pardon, I acquainted his
Lordship with some more considerable errata to be
found in the first volume of <i>Anglia Sacra</i>, out of which
I had drawn up as many mistakes as I could possibly
meet with, and had descanted upon them, as far as I
was able, in the same method Ant. Harmer had drawn
up his, and without acquainting the Bishop who was
the author, sent them up to his Lordship with license,
if he thought fitting, to print them. But when the
collection was made, I had prefixed a letter to his
Lordship, and next an epistle to the reader. In the
former it was but fitting to compliment his Lordship,
but the latter was altogether as large a commendation
of Dr. Wharton's skill, diligence, and faithfulness in
viewing and examining the records of our English
church history. The disgust that this last gave his
Lordship obliged him to stifle the whole tract; but yet
he was pleased to show part of it to many by way, as
I suppose, of excuse or answer for his own mistakes;
but as I take it, after the Doctor's decease, he made it
an occasion of foully bespattering him as a man of no
credit, and all he had writ in that <i>Specimen</i> was fit to
go for nothing; which practice of his lordship, after I
came to read both in the preface and introduction to
his third volume, I was amazed at his injustice both to
the living and the dead. For I had acquainted his
Lordship that the faults were none of Dr. Wharton's
own making, who had never seen the MS. itself, but
only some exscript of it, writ by some raw and illiterate
person employed by some of his Oxford friends to send
him a copy of it. I once threatened my Lord Bishop's
son that I had thoughts of publishing this and some
other facts the Bishop had used to avoid the discovery
of some other errata communicated to him by other
hands; but I forbore doing so, lest I should seem ungrateful
for kindnesses done and offered to me."</p>

<h3>EARLY PHILADELPHIA DIRECTORIES.</h3>

<p>The first Philadelphia Directories were published
in the year 1785, when two appeared: White's and
M'Pherson's. The latter is a duodecimo volume
of 164 pages, and contains some things worth
making a note of.</p>

<p>Some persons do not seem to have comprehended
the object of the inquiries made of the
inhabitants as to their names and occupations;
supposing, perhaps, that they had some connexion
with taxation. The answers given by such are
put down in the <i>Directory</i> as the <i>names</i> of the
respondents. Thus:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"'I won't tell you,' 3. Maiden's Lane."</p>

<p>"'I won't tell it,' 15. Sugar Alley."</p>

<p>"'I won't tell you my name,' 160. New Market
Street."</p>

<p>"'I won't have it numbered,' 478. Green Street."</p>

<p>"'I won't tell my name,' 185. St. John's Street."</p>

<p>"'I shall not give you my name,' 43. Stamper's
Alley."</p>

<p>"'What you please,' 49. Market Street."</p>

</blockquote>

<p>In the <i>errata</i> are the following:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"For Cross Woman read Cross Widow."</p>

<p>"For Cox Cats read Cox Cato."</p>

</blockquote>

<p>The alphabetical arrangement of a <i>Directory</i> is
as great a leveller as the grave. In the <i>Directory</i>
for 1798, after&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Dennis, Mr., <i>Taylor</i>, Pewter Platter Alley."</p>

</blockquote>

<p>appears the following:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Dorleans, Messrs., <i>Merchants</i>, near 100. South
Fourth Street."</p>

</blockquote>

<p>These were Louis Philippe and one of his brothers,
who lived at the north-west corner of Fourth and
Princes Streets, in a house still standing, and now
numbered 110.</p>

<p>Talleyrand and Volney lived for some time in
Philadelphia; but, not being house-keepers, their
names do not appear in any of the Directories.</p>

<h3>SHAKSPEARE CORRESPONDENCE.</h3>

<p><i>Shakspeare Readings, No. X.</i>&mdash;"<i>Sheer</i>" versus
"<i>Warwick-sheer</i>."&mdash;At page 143. of <i>Notes and
Emendations</i>, Mr. Collier indulges in the following
reverie:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Malone did not know what to make of 'sheer
ale,' but supposed that it meant <i>sheering</i> or reaping ale,
for so reaping is called in Warwickshire. What does
it mean? It is spelt <i>sheere</i> in the old copies; and that
word begins one line, <i>Warwick</i> having undoubtedly
dropped out at the end of the preceding line....
It was formerly not at all unusual to spell 'shire'
<i>sheere</i>; and Sly's 'sheer ale' <i>thus turns out</i> to have
been Warwickshire ale, which Shakspeare celebrated,
and of which he had doubtless often partaken at Mrs.
Hacket's. We almost wonder that, in his local particularity,
he did not mention the sign of her house," &amp;c.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>The meaning of <i>sheer</i> ale was <i>strong</i> ale&mdash;that
which we now call "entire"&mdash;ale unmixed, unreduced,
unmitigated&mdash;the antithesis of that
"<i>small</i> ale," for a pot of which poor Sly begged
so hard, sinking his demand at last to "a pot o' the
<i>smallest</i> ale." If Christopher lived in our own
times, he might, on common occasions, indulge in
<i>small</i>; but for great treats he would have Barclay's
entire: and, instead of bullying Dame Hacket
about "sealed quarts," he would perhaps, in these
educated days, be writing to <i>The Times</i> under the
signature of "A Thirsty Soul." Sly evidently was
rather proud of underlying a score of fourteenpence
for <i>sheer</i> ale.</p>

<p>Let us hear in what sense old Phil. Holland, in
<i>Precepts of Health</i>, uses the word:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"And verily water (not that onely wherewith <i>wine
is mingled</i>, but also which is drunke betweene whiles,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_169"></a>{169}</span>
apart by itselfe) causeth the wine tempered therewith
to doe the lesse harme: in regard whereof, a student
ought to use himselfe to drinke twice or thrice every
day a draught of sheere water," &amp;c.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Here "sheere water" is put in apposition to
that with which "<i>wine is mingled</i>;" the meaning
of <i>sheer</i>, therefore, is <i>integer</i>: and sheer milk
would be milk before it goes to the pump.</p>

<p>But perhaps it will be objected that sheer, applied
to water, as in this place, may mean clear,
bright, free from foulness. Well, then, here is
another example from Fletcher's <i>Double Marriage</i>,
where Castruccio is being <i>tantalised</i> after the
fashion of the Governor of Barataria:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"<i>Cast.</i> (<i>tastes.</i>) Why, what is this? Why, Doctor!</p>

<p><i>Doctor.</i> Wine and water, sir. 'Tis sovereign for your
heat: you must endure it.</p>

<p><i>Villio.</i> Most excellent to cool your night-piece, sir!</p>

<p><i>Doctor.</i> You're of a high and choleric complexion,
and must have allays.</p>

<p><i>Cast.</i> Shall I have no <span class="allsmcap">SHEER WINE</span> then?"</p>

</blockquote>

<p>The step from this to sheer ale is not very
difficult.</p>

<p>It may be remarked that, at present, we apply
several arbitrary adjectives, in this sense of sheer,
to different liquors. Thus, to spirits we apply
"raw," to wines and brandy "neat," to malt drink
"stout" or "strong;" and then we reduce to
"half and half," until at length we come to the
very "small," a term which, like other lowly
things, seems to have been permitted to endure
from its very weakness.</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p>Notwithstanding the comments upon this word
<i>clamour</i>, both in the pages of "N. &amp; Q.," and by
the various editors of Shakspeare, I have not yet
seen anything that appears to my mind like a
satisfactory elucidation.</p>

<p>Gifford, not being able to make anything of the
word, proposed to read <i>charm</i>, which at all events
is plausible, though nothing more. Nares says the
word is in use among bell-ringers, though now
shortened to <i>clam</i>. Unfortunately the meaning
attached to the term by the ringers is at variance
with that of <i>clamour</i> in the text; for to <i>clam</i> the
bells is what we should now call putting them <i>on
sette</i> or <i>setting</i> them, and this is but preparatory
to a general crash: still it is possible that the
words may be the same.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Mr. Arrowsmith</span> (Vol. vii., p. 567.) maintains
the genuineness of <i>clamour</i> in preference to <i>charm</i>;
and, without a word of comment, quotes two passages
from Udall's translation of Erasmus his
<i>Apothegms</i>&mdash;"oneless hee chaumbreed his tongue,"
&amp;c.; and again&mdash;"did he refrein or chaumbre
the tauntying of his tongue." I confess I cannot
fathom <span class="sc">Mr. Arrowsmith's</span> intention; for the
obvious conclusion to be drawn from these quotations
is, that <i>charm</i>, and not <i>clamour</i>, is an abbreviation
of the older word <i>chaumbre</i>.</p>

<p>I am very much inclined to think that the verb
in question comes directly from the A.-S. We
find the word <i>clam</i> or <i>clom</i>&mdash;a bond, that which
holds or retains, a prison; in the latter form the
word is frequently used, and for the use of the
former in the same sense Bosworth quotes Boethius
(Rawlinson's ed., Oxon. 1698, p. 152.), which
work I am unable to consult. From these words,
then, we have <i>clommian</i>, <i>clæmian</i>, &amp;c., to bind or
restrain. It seems not very unlikely that from
this original came Shakspeare's word <i>clammer</i> or
<i>clamour</i>. I may add that Skinner explains the
word <i>clum</i> by <i>a note of silence</i>, quoting "Chaucer
in fab. Molitoris" (I have no copy of Chaucer at
this moment within reach); and in the A.-S. we
find <i>clumian</i>, to keep close, to press, to mutter,
comprimere, mussitare: all these words probably
have the same root.</p>

<p>An instance of the use of the word <i>clame</i> or
<i>clamour</i> is to be found in a work entitled <i>The
Castel of Helthe; gathered and made by Syr
Thomas Elyot, Knight, &amp;c.; printed by Thomas
Berthelet</i>: London, 1539 (black-letter). At p. 52.
is the following:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Nauigation or rowynge nigh to the lande, in a
<i>clame</i> water, is expedient for them that haue dropsies,
lepries, palseyes, called of the vulgar people, takynges,
and francies. To be carried on a rough water, it is a
violent exercise," &amp;c.</p>

<p><i>Shakspeare Suggestions</i> (Vol. viii., p. 124.).&mdash;Icon
asks&mdash;"Has any one suggested 'Most
busy, when least I do.' The 'it' seems mere surplusage?"</p>

<p>The same suggestion, nearly <i>verbatim</i>, even to
the curtailment of the "it," may be found in this
present month's number of <i>Blackwood's Magazine</i>,
p. 186.</p>

<p>But <span class="sc">Icon</span> will also find the same reading, <i>with
an anterior title of nearly three years</i>, together with
some good reasons for its adoption, in "N. &amp; Q.,"
Vol. ii., p. 338. And he may also consult with advantage
an illustrative quotation in Vol. iii., p. 229.</p>

<p>In the original suggestion in "N. &amp; Q.," there
is no <i>presumption of surplusage</i>: the word "it" is
understood in relation to <i>labours</i>; that word being
taken as <i>a collective singular</i>, like <i>contents</i>, and
other words of the same construction.</p>

<p>The critic in Blackwood disclaims consulting
"N. &amp; Q.;" and it is, no doubt, a convenient disclaimer.
He follows the herd of menstrual Aristarchi,
by hailing, with wondering admiration, the
substitution of <i>ethics</i> for <i>checks</i>! And he shows
his fitness for the task he has undertaken, by stating<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_170"></a>{170}</span>
that "Mr. Singer <i>alone</i> had the good taste to
print it (ethics) in his text of 1826."</p>

<p>Mr. Halliwell, however, in a recent pamphlet,
states that&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"This <i>new emendation</i> has not only been mentioned
in a great variety of editions, but <i>has been introduced
into the text by no fewer than five editors</i>, the first, I
believe, in point of time, being the Rev. J. Rann, who
substituted ethics into the text as early as 1787."</p>

<p><i>Critical Digest.</i>&mdash;Your readers have seen
no more welcome announcement than that contained
in p. 75. of your present volume, that this
project of a work, bringing into one view the
labours of preceding editors and commentators, is
in good hands and likely to be brought to bear.
On the <i>form</i> of such a work it is perhaps premature
to offer an observation; but, to be perfect, it
ought to range with that remarkable monument
of a lady's patient industry, Mrs. Cowden Clarke's
<i>Concordance</i>. On the <i>materials</i> to be employed,
all your readers have such an interest in the subject
as to warrant them in making suggestions;
and it will be well to do so before the plans are
fully matured.</p>

<p>It ought, in my opinion, to be more comprehensive
than even the largest scheme suggested by
your correspondent; for, in addition to the comments
which may be thought most worthy of insertion
in full, or nearly so, it ought to contain at least
a <i>reference</i> to every known comment, in the slightest
degree worthy of notice, in relation to any passage
in the work. To accomplish this would of course
be a work of enormous labour, and the object of
the present Note is to suggest, as first step, the
circulation of a list of works intended to be consulted,
for the purpose of inviting additions; not
that such a list should encumber the pages of
"N. &amp; Q." but I am much mistaken if you would
not afford facilities for receiving the communications
asked for. This course is the more necessary,
inasmuch as, in addition to works written exclusively
on the subject of Shakspeare, there is a
vast amount of Shakspearian criticism spread over
works, the titles of which give no indication of the
necessity for consulting them. For instance, upwards
of two hundred pages of Coleridge's <i>Literary
Remains</i> are so employed; and though, perhaps,
the work is so well known that it would have
found a place in the first copy of the list I have
suggested, it may serve as an illustration of the
sort of information which it would be desirable to
invite.</p>

<h3>MOTTOS OF THE EMPERORS OF GERMANY.</h3>

<p>I was much interested in the lists given in
"N. &amp; Q." last year of the mottos adopted by
serjeants-at-law on arriving at that dignity; and
it then occurred to me, that it would be curious
to collect in like manner a complete list of the
sentences, which, as is well known to students of
history, the Emperors of Germany were accustomed
to assume at their coronations. A recent
visit to Frankfort has given me an opportunity of
making and sending you such a list. The materials
are collected from inscriptions on a series of imperial
portraits which adorn the principal chamber
in the Römer or town hall of that city. The
list, if it have no other interest, will at least serve
to remind us that some of the Latin aphorisms and

selected. A glance at these names furnishes a

<p>It is scarcely necessary to remind your readers,
that the integrity of Charlemagne's empire was
preserved until the deposition of Charles the Fat;
that France and Germany did not become separate
until after that event; and that Conrad was,
therefore, the first of the German sovereigns, as
he was certainly the first elected by the confederate
princes.</p>

Cambridge; the cotemporary of Gray and Mason,
and well known for his literary and scientific attainments:</p>

<h2>Minor Queries.</h2>

<p><i>Fox-hunting.</i>&mdash;Can any of your correspondents
inform me, when the great national sport of fox-hunting
first came into vogue?</p>

<p>Gervase Markham, whose work on sports, called
<i>Country Contentments, or the Husbandman's Recreations</i>,
was published in 1654, gives due honour to
stag-hunting, which he describes as "the most
princely and royall chase of all chases." Speaking
of hare-hunting, he says, "It is every honest man's
and good man's chase, and which is indeed the
freest, readiest, and most enduring pastime;" but
he classes the hunting of the fox and the badger
together, and he describes them as "Chases of a
great deal lesse use or cunning than any of the
former, because they are of a much hotter scent,
and as being intituled stinking scents, and not
sweet scents."</p>

<p>Although he does admit that this chase may be
profitable and pleasant for the time, insomuch as
there are not so many defaults, but a continuing
sport; he concludes, "I will not stand much upon
them, because they are not so much desired as the
rest."</p>

<p><i>Memorial of Newton.</i>&mdash;The subscription now
in progress for raising a statue to Sir Isaac Newton<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_173"></a>{173}</span>
at Grantham, the place of his early education,
recalls to my recollection a memorial of him, about
which I may possibly learn a few particulars from
some one of the numerous readers of "N. &amp; Q."</p>

<p>I remember hearing when a school-boy at the
college, Grantham, some thirty-five years ago, that
Newton's name, cut by himself on a stone in the
recess of one of the windows of the school-house,
was to be seen there no long time back; but that
the stone, or the portion of it which contained the
name, had been cut out by some mason at a time
when the building was being repaired, and was in
the possession of a gentleman then living in the
largest house in Grantham&mdash;built, I believe, by
himself. Those of your readers who knew Grantham
at the time, will not need to be told the
name of the gentleman to whom I allude. The
questions I would wish to ask are these:</p>

<p>1. Was such a stone to be seen, as described,
some forty or fifty years since?</p>

<p>2. Is it true that it was removed in the way
that I have stated?</p>

<p>3. If so, in whose possession is the stone at this
present time?</p>

<p><i>Mammon.</i>&mdash;Perhaps some of your readers could

<p>"Mammon is a Syriac word, <i>a name given to an idol
worshipped as the god of riches</i>. It has the same meaning
as Plutus among the Greeks. It is not known that
the Jews even formally worshipped <i>this idol</i>, but they
used the word to denote wealth."</p>

<p><i>Derivation of Wellesley.</i>&mdash;In a note to the
lately published <i>Autobiographic Sketches</i> of Thomas
De Quincey, I find (p. 131.) the following passage:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"It had been always known that some relationship
existed between the Wellesleys and John Wesley.
Their names had in fact been originally the same; and
the Duke of Wellington himself, in the earlier part of
his career, when sitting in the Irish House of Commons,
was always known to the Irish journals as
Captain Wesley. Upon this arose a natural belief,
that the aristocratic branch of the house had improved
the name into Wellesley. But the true process of
change had been precisely the other way. Not Wesley
had been expanded into Wellesley, but inversely, Wellesley
had been contracted by household usage into
Wesley. The name must have been <i>Wellesley</i> in its
earliest stage, since it was founded upon a connexion
with Wells Cathedral."</p>

</blockquote>

<p>May I ask what this connexion was, and whence
the authority for the statement? Had the illustrious
Duke's adoption of his title from another
town in Somersetshire anything to do with it?</p>

<p><i>The Battle of Cruden&mdash;A Query for Copenhagen
Correspondents.</i>&mdash;In the year 1059, in the
reign of Malcolm III., king of Scotland, a battle
was fought on the Links of Cruden, in the county
of Aberdeen, between the Danes and the Scots,
in which the Prince Royal, who commanded the
Danish forces, was slain. He was buried on the
Danish field, near to which, according to the custom of
the times, King Malcolm "biggit ane kirk." This
church was overblown with sand, and another
built farther inland, which is the present parish
church. To the churchyard wall there leans a
black marble gravestone, about 7 ft. × 3 ft. 6 in.,
which is said to have been sent from Denmark as
a monument for the grave of his royal highness.
The stone has the appearance of considerable antiquity
about it, and appears to have been inlaid
with marble, let into it about half an inch; the
marks of the iron brads, and the lead which secured
it, are still visible.</p>

<div class="poem">
  <div class="stanza">
    <p>"Tradition says it did from Denmark come,</p>
    <p>A monument the king sent for his son."</p>
  </div>
</div>

<p>And it is also stated that, until within the last
hundred years, a small sum of money was annually
sent by the Danish government to the minister of
Cruden for keeping the monument in repair. I
should be glad to learn if there are any documents
among the royal archives at Copenhagen, which
would invalidate or substantiate the popular tradition.</p>

<h3>ROSICRUCIANS.</h3>

<p class="center">(Vol. vii., p. 619.; Vol. viii., p. 106.)</p>

<p>We frequently see Queries made in these pages
which could be satisfactorily answered by turning
to the commonest books of reference, such as
Brand, Fosbroke, Hone, the various dictionaries
and encyclopædias, and the standard works on
the subjects queried. Now it seems to me that
"N. &amp; Q." is not intended for going over old
ground, and thus becoming a literary treadmill;
but its mission lies in supplying information <i>not
easily found</i>, and in perfecting, as far as possible,
our standard works and books of reference. <span class="sc">Mr.
Taylor's</span> Query affords an opportunity for this,
as the ordinary sources of information are very
deficient as regards the Rosicrucians.</p>

<p>According to some, the name is derived from
their supposed founder, <i>Christian Rosencreutz</i>, who
died in 1484. And they account for the fact of
the Rosicrucians not being heard of till 1604, by
saying that Rosencreutz bound his disciples by an
oath not to promulgate his doctrines for 120 years
after his death. The mystical derivation of the
name is thus given in the <i>Encyc. Brit.</i>:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The denomination evidently appears to be derived
from the science of chemistry. It is not compounded,
as many imagine, of the two words <i>rosa</i> and <i>crux</i>,
which signify <i>rose</i> and <i>cross</i>, but of the latter of these
two words and the Latin <i>ros</i>, which signifies <i>dew</i>. Of
all natural bodies <i>dew</i> was deemed the most powerful
dissolvent of gold; and the <i>cross</i> in the chemical language
is equivalent to <i>light</i>, because the figure of the
<i>cross</i> exhibits at the same time the three letters of
which the word <i>lux</i>, light, is compounded. Now <i>lux</i>
is called by this sect the seed or menstruum of the red
dragon, or, in other words, gross and corporeal <i>light</i>,
which, when properly digested and modified, produces
<i>gold</i>. Hence it follows, if this etymology be admitted,
that a Rosicrucian philosopher is one who, by the intervention
and assistance of the <i>dew</i>, seeks for light;
or, in other words, the philosopher's stone.</p>

<p>"The true meaning and energy of this denomination
did not escape the penetration and sagacity of Gassendi,
as appears by his <i>Examen Philos. Fludd</i>, tom. iii. s. 15.
p. 261.; and it was more fully explained by Renaudot
in his <i>Conférences Publiques</i>, tom. iv. p. 87."</p>

</blockquote>

<p>The encyclopædist remarks that at first the title
commanded some respect, as it seemed to be borrowed
from <i>the arms of Luther, which were a cross
placed upon a rose</i>.</p>

<p>The leading doctrines of the Rosicrucians were
borrowed from the Eastern philosophers<a name="footnotetag4" href="#footnote4"><sup>[4]</sup></a>; the
Christian Platonists, schoolmen, and mystics:
mixed up with others derived from writers on
natural history, magic, astrology, and especially
alchemy. All these blended together, and served
up in a professional jargon of studied obscurity,
formed the doctrinal system of these strange philosophers.
In this system <i>the doctrine of elemental
spirits</i>, and the means of communion and alliance
with them, and <i>the doctrine of signatures</i>, are the
most prominent points.</p>

<p>Let me refer <span class="sc">Mr. Taylor</span> to Michael Meyer's
<i>Themis Aurea, hoc est de legibus Fraternitatis Roseæ
Crucis</i>, Col. 1615; the works of Jacob Behmen,
Robt. Fludd, John Heydon, Peter Mormius, Eugene
Philalethes; the works of the Rosicrucian Society,
containing seventy-one treatises in different
languages; the Catalogue of Hermetic books by
the Abbé Lenglet du Fresnoi, Paris, 1762; Manget's
<i>Biblioth. Chem. Curios.</i>, Col. 1702, 2 vols.
folio; and the <i>Theatrum Chemicum</i>, Argent. 1662,
6 vols. 8vo.</p>

<p>I must make particular mention of the two
most celebrated of the Rosicrucian works; the
first is <i>La Chiave del Cabinetto</i>, Col. 1681, 12mo.
The author, Joseph Francis Borri, gives a most
systematic account of the doctrine of the Rosic
Cross in this interesting little volume. He was
imprisoned for magic and heresy, and died in his
prison at Rome in 1695 at the age of seventy
years. On this work was founded one still more
remarkable&mdash;</p>

Sciences Secrètes. 'Quod tanto impendio absconditur

Barbin.&mdash;<span class="allsmcap">M.DC.LXXI.</span> 12mo., pp. 150."</p>

</blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_176"></a>{176}</span></p>

<p>This work, thus published anonymously, was from
the pen of the Abbé de Villars. An English
translation was published at London in 1714.</p>

<p>The doctrine of the Rosy Cross entered largely
into the literature of the seventeenth century.
This applies especially to the masques of James I.
and Charles I. To the same source Shakspeare
owes his <i>Ariel</i>, and Milton much of his <i>Comus</i>.</p>

<p>It is strange, but instructive, to observe how
variously different minds make use of the same
materials. What greater contrast can we have
than <i>The Rape of the Lock</i> and <i>Undine</i>?&mdash;the
one redolent of the petit-maître and the Cockney;
the other a work <i>sui generis</i>, of human conceptions
the most exquisite and spirit-fragrant. Wieland's
<i>Idris and Zenide</i>, Bulwer's <i>Zanoni</i>, and Mackay's
<i>Salamandrine</i>, are also based on Rosicrucian principles.
Mention of the Rosicrucians occurs in
Izaak Walton's Angler and Butler's <i>Hudibras</i>&mdash;see
Zachary Grey's note and authorities referred
to by him. See also two interesting papers on the
subject in Chambers's <i>Edinb. Journal</i>, ed. 1846,

book of Rosicrucian emblems, as I have it beside
me:</p>

<p>The title-page is adorned with emblematical

<p>The Jewish speculations on the subject of elemental
spirits and angels (especially those that assumed
corporeal forms, and united themselves with the daughters
of men) were largely drawn on by the Rosicrucians.

<h3>SEARSON'S POEMS.</h3>

<p class="center">(Vol. vii., p. 131.)</p>

<p>John Searson was a merchant in Philadelphia in
the year 1766. A few days before seeing the inquiry
respecting him, I came across his advertisement
in the <i>Pennsylvania Gazette</i>; but not having
made a note of the date, I have since been unable
to find it. His stock was of a very miscellaneous
character, as "Bibles and warming pans," "spelling-books
and swords," figured in it in juxtaposition.
He taught school at one time in Basking
Ridge, New Jersey.</p>

<p>A copy of his poem on "Down Hill" is before
me; and it is quite as curious a production as the
volume of poems which he afterwards published.</p>

<p>He describes himself in the title-page as "Late
Master of the Free School in Colerain, and formerly
of New York, Merchant." The volume was printed
in 1794 by subscription at Colerain.</p>

<p>The work is introduced by "A Poem, being a
Cursory View of Belfast Town," thus commencing:</p>

<div class="poem">
  <div class="stanza">
    <p>"With pleasure I view the Town of Belfast,</p>
    <p>Where many dear friends their lots have been cast:</p>
    <p>The Buildings are neat, the Town very clean,</p>
    <p>And Trade very brisk are here to be seen;</p>
    <p>Their Shipping are numerous, as I behold,</p>
    <p>And Merchants thrive here in riches, I'm told."</p>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Here are some farther specimens from this poem:</p>

<div class="poem">
  <div class="stanza">
    <p>"I've walk'd alone, and view'd the <i>Paper Mill</i>,</p>
    <p>Its walk, the eye with pleasure fill.</p>
    <p>I've view'd the Mountains that surround <span class="sc">Belfast</span>,</p>
    <p>And find they are romantic to the last.</p>
    <p>...</p>
    <p>The Church of <span class="sc">Belfast</span> is superb and grand,</p>
    <p>And to the Town an ornament does stand;</p>
    <p>Their Meeting Houses also is so neat,</p>
    <p>The congregation large, fine and complete."</p>
  </div>
</div>

<p>The volume contains a dedication to the Rev.
Mr. Josiah Marshall, rector of Maghera, a preface,
a table of contents, and "A Prayer previous to the
Poem."</p>

<p>The whole book is so intensely ridiculous that
it is difficult to select. The following are rather
chosen for their brevity than for any pre-eminent
absurdity:</p>

    <p>"The rabbit tribe about me run their way,</p>

    <p>Alas! how little do these creatures know</p>

<p>Some of the London booksellers ought to reprint
this work as a curiosity of literature. Some
of the subscribers took a number of copies, and
one might be procured for the purpose. The
country seats of the largest subscribers are described
in the poem.</p>

<p>The book ends with these lines (added by the
"devil" of the printing-office, no doubt):</p>

<h3>"FROM THE SUBLIME TO THE RIDICULOUS," ETC.</h3>

<p class="center">(Vol. v., p. 100.)</p>

<p>Since my former communication on the use of
the phrase "From the sublime to the ridiculous
there is but a step," I have met with some farther
examples of kindred forms of expression, which
you may deem worth inserting in "N. &amp; Q."</p>

<p>Shakspeare has an instance in <i>Romeo and Juliet</i>,
where he describes "Love" as&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
  <div class="stanza">
    <p class="i8">"A madness most discreet,</p>
    <p>A choaking gall, and a preserving sweet."</p>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Quarles has it in his <i>Emblems</i>, Book iv. Epigram
2.:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
  <div class="stanza">
    <p>"Pilgrim, trudge on; what makes thy soul complain?</p>
    <p>Crowns thy complaint; the way to rest is pain:</p>
    <p>The road to resolution lies by doubt;</p>
    <p>The next way home's the farthest way about."</p>
  </div>
</div>

<p>We find it in this couplet in Butler:</p>

<div class="poem">
  <div class="stanza">
    <p>"For discords make the sweetest airs,</p>
    <p>And curses are a kind of prayers."</p>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Rochester has it in the line&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
  <div class="stanza">
    <p>"An eminent fool must be a man of parts."</p>
  </div>
</div>

<p>It occurs in Junius's remark&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Your Majesty may learn hereafter how nearly the
slave and the tyrant are allied."</p>

</blockquote>

<p>and in the following well-known passage in the
same writer:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"He was forced to go through every division, resolution,
composition, and refinement of political
chemistry, before he happily arrived at the <i>caput
mortuum</i> of vitriol in your grace. Flat and insipid in
your retired state; but, brought into action, you
become vitriol again. Such are the extremes of alternate
indolence or fury which have governed your
whole administration."</p>

</blockquote>

<p>The thought here (be it said in passing) seems
to have been adopted from these lines in Rochester:</p>

<div class="poem">
  <div class="stanza">
    <p>"Wit, like tierce claret, when 't begins to pall,</p>
    <p>Neglected lies, and 's of no use at all;</p>
    <p>But in its full perfection of decay</p>
    <p>Turns vinegar, and comes again in play."</p>
  </div>
</div>

<p>But the most beautiful application of this sentiment
that I have met with, occurs in an essay on
"The Uses of Adversity," by Mr. Herman Hooker,
an American writer:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"A pious lady, who had lost her husband, was for a
time inconsolable. She could not think, scarcely could
she speak, of anything but him. Nothing seemed to
take her attention but the three promising children he
had left her, singing to her his presence, his look, his
love. But soon these were all taken ill, and died within
a few days of each other; and now the childless
mother was calmed even by the greatness of the stroke.
As the lead that goes quickly down to the ocean's
depth ruffled its surface less than lighter things, so the
blow which was strongest did not so much disturb her
calm of mind, but drove her to its proper trust."</p>

<h3>PASSAGE IN THE BURIAL SERVICE.</h3>

<p class="center">(Vol. iii., p. 78.)</p>

<p>"In the midst of life we are in death."</p>

<p>A writer in the <i>Parish Choir</i> (vol. iii. p. 140.)
gives the following account of this passage. He
says:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The passage in question is found in the <i>Cantarium
Sti. Galli</i>, or choir-book of the monks of St. Gall in
Switzerland, published in 1845, with, however, a slight
deviation from the text, as we are accustomed to it.</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="center">'<i>Mediâ Vitâ of St. Notker.</i></p>

<p>'Mediâ Vitâ in morte sumus: quem quærimus adjutorem,
nisi Te Domine, qui pro peccatis nostris justè
irasceris. Ad te clamaverunt patres nostri, speraverunt,
et liberasti eos. Sancte Deus: ad te clamaverunt patres
nostri, clamaverunt et non sunt confusi. Sancte Fortis,
ne despicias nos in tempore senectutis: cum defecerit
virtus nostra, ne derelinquas nos. Sancte et misericors
Salvator amaræ morti ne tradas nos.'</p>

</blockquote>

<p>"On consulting the <i>Thesaurus Hymnologicus</i> of
Daniel (vol. ii. p. 329.) I find the following notice.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_178"></a>{178}</span>
It is called 'Antiphona pro Peccatis,' or 'de Morte;'
and the text there given corresponds nearly with that
in our Burial Service.</p>

<p>"Rambach says, '"In the midst of life" occurs in
MSS. of the thirteenth century, as an universally common
dirge and song of supplication on all melancholy
occasions, and was in this century regularly sung at
Compline on Saturdays. A German translation was
known long before the time of Luther, and was enlarged
by him by the addition of two strophes.' Martene
describes it as forming part of a religious service
for New Year's Eve, composed about the year 1800.</p>

<p>"Hoffmann says that this anthem 'by Notker the
Stammerer, a monk of St. Gall's (an. 912), was an
extremely popular battle-song, through the singing of
which, before and during the fight, friend and foe
hoped to conquer. It was also, on many occasions,
used as a kind of incantation song. Therefore the
Synod of Cologne ordered (an. 1316) that no one
should sing the <i>Mediâ vitâ</i> without the leave of his
bishop.'</p>

<p>"Daniel adds that it is not, to his knowledge, now
used by the Roman Church in divine worship; but
that the admirable hymn of Luther, 'Mitten wir im
Leben sind,' still flourishes amongst the Protestants of
Germany, just as the translation in our Prayer-Book
is popular with us."</p>

<p class="author"><span class="sc">Geo. A. Trevor.</span></p>

<p>Your correspondent J. G. T. asks whence comes
the expression in the Burial Service, "In the
midst of life we are in death?" There are some
lines in Petrarch which express precisely the same
idea in nearly the self-same words; but as the
thought is by no means an unlikely one to occur
to two separate and independent authors, we may
not go to the length of charging the seeming plagiarism
upon the compilers of our Prayer-Book.

<h3>PATRICK'S PURGATORY.</h3>

<p class="center">(Vol. vii., p. 552.)</p>

<p>Dr. Lanigan, in his learned <i>Ecclesiastical History
of Ireland</i> (vol. i. p. 368.), states that the so-called
Patrick's Purgatory is situated at Lough
Derg (Donegal). It is never mentioned in any
of the lives of the apostle, nor heard of till the
eleventh century, the period at which the canons
regular of St. Augustine first appeared, for it was
to persons of that order, as the story goes, that
St. Patrick confided the care of that cavern of
wonders. Now there were no such persons in the
island in which it is situated, nor in that of St.
Davoc [Dabeoc?] in the same lake, until about the
beginning of the twelfth century. This purgatory,
or purging place, of Lough Derg, was set up against
another Patrick's purgatory, viz. that of <span class="correction" title="Original reads 'Crough'.">Croagh</span>
Patrick, mentioned by Jocelyn, which, however
ill-founded the vulgar opinion concerning it, was
less objectionable. Some writers have said that
it got the name of Patrick's Purgatory from an
Abbot Patrick, that lived in the ninth century;
but neither were there canons regular of St. Augustine
at that time, nor were such abridged
modes of atoning to the Almighty for the sins of a
whole life then thought of. It was demolished in
the year 1497, by order of the Pope, although it
has since been in some manner restored.</p>

<p>The original Patrick's Purgatory then, it would
appear, was at Croagh Patrick, in Mayo, near
Westport; speaking of the pilgrimages made to
which, the monk Jocelyn (in his <i>Life of St. Patrick</i>,
written <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 1180, cap. 172.) says that&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Some of those who spent a night there stated that
they had been subjected to most fearful torments, which
had the effect, as they supposed, of purging them from
their sins, for which reason also certain of them gave
to that place the name of St. Patrick's Purgatory."</p>

</blockquote>

<p>By the authority of the Lords Justices who
governed Ireland in 1633, previously to the appointment
of Wentworth, Lough Derg Purgatory
was once more suppressed; but the sort of piety
then fostered among the members of the Roman
communion in Ireland could ill afford to resign
without a struggle what was to them a source of
so much consolation. High influence was, therefore,
called into action to procure the reversal of
the sentence; and the Roman Catholic Queen of
Charles I. was induced to address to the Lord
Deputy of Ireland a letter in which she requested
that he would be pleased "to allow, that the
devotions which the people of that country have
ever been wont to pay to a St. Patrick's place
there, may not be abolished." The Lord Deputy
declined acceding to this request, and said in his
reply, "I fear, at this time, when some men's zeal
hath run them already, not only beyond their
wits, <i>but almost forth of their allegiance too</i>, it
might furnish them with something to say in prejudice
and scandal to his majesty's government,
which, for the present indeed, is by all means to
be avoided." And adds, "your Majesty might do
passing well to let this devotion rest awhile."
After this second suppression, the devotion has a
second time been "in some manner restored;" and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_179"></a>{179}</span>
multitudes throng to the place on the faith of a
false tradition, so long since exposed and exploded
by their own authorities. Three hundred and
fifty years ago, the Pope, the representative of the
Bishop of Clogher, and the head of the Franciscans
in Donegal, combined their efforts to put down
the scandalous fabrication; but yet it remains to
this day an object of cherished religious veneration&mdash;an
object of confidence and faith, on which
many a poor soul casts itself to find consolation
and repose. And those multitudes of pilgrims,
year after year, assemble there, no influence which
they look to for guidance forbidding them, to do
homage to the vain delusion.</p>

<h3>LORD WILLIAM RUSSELL.</h3>

<p class="center">(Vol. viii., p. 100.)</p>

<p>In answer to W. L. M.'s inquiry, "where the
virtuous and patriotic William Lord Russell was
buried?" I beg to state that I possess a pamphlet
entitled:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The whole Tryal and Defence of William Lord
Russel, who Dyed a Martyr to the <i>Romish</i> Fury in
the Year 1683, with the Learned Arguments of the
Council on both sides. Together with his Behaviour
and Speech upon the Scaffold: His Character and
Behaviour. London: printed by J. Bradford, at the
Bible in Fetter Lane."</p>

</blockquote>

<p>There is no date to it; but from the appearance
of the paper, type, a rude woodcut of the execution,
&amp;c., I doubt not that it was printed soon
after the event, or certainly immediately after the
Revolution, to meet the popular wishes to have
information on the subject. It consists of sixteen
octavo pages, very closely printed. The opening
paragraph says:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Among the many that suffered in a <i>Protestant</i>
cause [all the <i>Italics</i> used in this communication are
those of the pamphlet], and indeed whose measure
seem'd to be the hardest of all, was this honorable person
<i>William</i> Lord <i>Russel</i>, who was generally lamented
for his excellent Temper and good Qualities; being
allowed to be one of the most sober and judicious
Noblemen in the Kingdom, which even his Enemies
could not deny; and the Merit and Esteem he bore
was more cause of Offence against him than any Matter
that was reap'd up at his Tryal; all which in effect
was merely grounded upon Malice (I mean <i>Popish</i>
Malice) that could not be forgot, from his Lordship's
being one of those earnest sticklers for <i>Protestant</i>
Liberty, and even the very foremost that prefer'd the
Bill of Exclusion," &amp;c.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Then follows the trial, headed "July 13, 1683,
the <i>Lord</i> Russel <i>came to his Tryal at the</i> Old
Bailey." The indictment is described; the names
of the jury are given; judges and counsel named;
the evidence, examinations, and cross-examinations
(by Lord Russel) very interestingly narrated:
the Report concluding, after a short address from
Lord Russel, "Then the Court adjourned till
four in the afternoon, and brought him in guilty."</p>

<p>These particulars are followed by "<i>The last
Speech and Carriage of the Lord</i> Russel <i>upon the
Scaffold, &amp;c.</i>" As to the executioner's work, all
other accounts that I have seen state that after
"two" strokes the head was severed from the
body. The publication says:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The Executioner, missing at his first Stroke,
though with that he took away his Life, at two more
severed the Head from the Body.... Mr. Sheriff
[continues the account] ordered his Friends or Servants
to take the Body, and dispose of it as they pleased,
being given them by His Majesty's <i>Favour and Bounty</i>."</p>

</blockquote>

<p>The narrative proceeds:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"His Body was conveyed to <i>Cheneys</i> in <i>Buckinghamshire</i>,
where 'twas Buried among his Ancestors. There
was a great <i>Storm</i>, and many loud <i>Claps</i> of <i>Thunder</i>
the Day of his <i>Martyrdom</i>. An <i>Elegy</i> was made on
him immediately after his Death, which seems, by
what we have of it, to be writ with some <i>Spirit</i>, and a
great deal of Truth and Good-will; only this Fragment
on't could be retriev'd, which yet may not be
unwelcome to the Reader:</p>

<div class="poem">
  <div class="stanza">
    <p>'<i>'Tis done&mdash;he's</i> Crown'd, <i>and one bright</i> Martyr <i>more</i>,</p>
    <p><i>Black</i> Rome, <i>is charg'd on thy too bulky score.</i></p>
    <p><i>All</i> like himself, <i>he mov'd so calm, so free</i>,</p>
    <p><i>A general whisper question'd</i>&mdash;Which is he?</p>
    <p><i>Decked like a</i> Lover&mdash;<i>tho' pale Death's his</i> Bride,</p>
    <p><i>He</i> came, <i>and</i> saw, <i>and</i> overcame, <i>and</i> dy'd.</p>
    <p><i>Earth weeps, and all the vainly pitying Crowd</i>:</p>
    <p><i>But Heaven his Death in</i> Thunder <i>groan'd aloud.'</i>"</p>
  </div>
</div>

</blockquote>

<p>A "sketch of his character" closes the account.
Perhaps W. S. M. may deem these particulars not
wholly uninteresting, but tolerably conclusive,
considering the time of publication, when the fact
must have been notorious.</p>

<h3>OAKEN TOMBS, ETC.</h3>

<p class="center">(Vol. vii., p. 528.)</p>

<p>At Banham, Norfolk, in a recess in the wall of
the north aisle of the church, is an oaken effigy
of a knight in armour in a recumbent position.
Blomefield says:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"It is plain that it was made for Sir Hugh Bardolph,
Knight, sometime lord of Gray's Manor, in this town,
who died in 1203, for under his left arm there is a
large cinquefoil, which is the badge of that family," &amp;c.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Since he wrote, however (1739), with a view to
the better preservation of this interesting relic,
some spirited churchwarden has caused it to be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_180"></a>{180}</span>
well painted and sanded so that it now looks
<i>almost</i> as well as stone. At the same time, the
marks by which Blomefield thought to identify it
are necessarily obliterated.</p>

<p class="author">T. B. B. H.</p>

<p>William de Valence, Earl of Pembroke, who
was slain at Bayonne in 1296,&mdash;his effigy in wood
is in St. Edmund's Chapel in Westminster Abbey,
covered with enamelled brass. There is also in
Abergavenny Church, amongst the general wreck
of monumental remains there, a cross-legged effigy
in wood, represented in chain mail; which the
late Sir Samuel Meyrick supposed to have been
that of William de Valence. It is mentioned in
Coxe's <i>Monmouthshire</i>, p. 192.</p>

<p>The effigy of Aymer de Valence referred to in
Whitaker ("N. &amp; Q.," Vol. vii., p. 528.) is not of
wood; he evidently refers to that of William de
Valence.</p>

<p>In Gloucester Cathedral there is the wooden
monument of a cross-legged knight attributed to
Robert Duke of Normandy, the eldest son of the
Conqueror; but it is probably of a little later
period.</p>

<p>In the Cathedral of Gloucester, there is a
wooden effigy of the unfortunate Robert Duke of
Normandy, eldest son of the Conqueror. It is so
many years since I saw it, that I do not offer any
description: but, if my memory be correct, it has
the legs crossed, and (what is curious) is loose,
and can be turned about on the tomb.</p>

<p>Exeter.</p>

<p>On the south side of the chancel of St. Giles'
Church, Durham, is a wooden effigy in full armour;
the head resting on a helmet, and the hands raised
as in prayer. It is supposed to be the tomb of
John Heath, who became possessed of the Hospital
of St. Giles Kepyer, and is known to have been
buried in the chancel of St. Giles' Church. He
died in 1590. At the feet of the wooden effigy,
are the words "<span class="allsmcap">HODIE MICHI</span>." The figure was
restored in colours about ten years ago.</p>

<p>is Rabbi Mayir ben Isaac. The above eight lines
are almost a literal translation of four Chaldee
ones, which form part of a beautiful ode on the
attributes of God, not unmixed with a considerable
proportion of the fabulous, which is sung in every
synagogue during the service of the first day of
the feast of Pentecost.</p>

<p>May I now be permitted to ask you, or any of
your numerous correspondents, to inform me who
was the <i>bonâ fide</i> translator of Rabbi Mayir ben
Isaac's lines? The English lines are often quoted
by itinerant advocates of charity societies as having
been found inscribed, according to some, on
the walls of a lunatic asylum, according to others,
on the walls of a prison, as occasion requires; but
extempore quotations on platforms are sometimes
vague.</p>

<p class="author"><span class="sc">Moses Margoliouth.</span></p>

<p>Wybunbury.</p>

<p>The verses are in Grose's <i>Olio</i> (p. 292.), and
are there said to be written by nearly an idiot,
then living (March 16, 1779) at Cirencester. It
happens, however, that long before the supposed
idiot was born, one Geoffrey Chaucer made use of
the same idea, and the same expressions, although
applied to a totally different subject, viz. in his
"Balade warnynge men to beware of deceitful
women:"&mdash;</p>

<p>Again in the "Remedie of Love," the same lines
occur with a few slight alterations.</p>

<p>In vol. x. of the <i>Modern Universal History</i>,
p. 430. <i>note</i>, I meet with this sentence:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"He was succeeded by Jochanan; not in right of
descent, but of his extraordinary merits; which the
Rabbies, according to custom, have raised to so surprising
a height, that, according to them, if the whole
heavens were paper, all the trees in the world pens,
and all the men writers, they would not suffice to pen
down all his lessons."</p>

</blockquote>

<p>In later times, in Miss C. Sinclair's <i>Hill and
Valley</i>, p. 25., we have:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"If the lake could be transformed into an ink-stand,
the mountains into paper; and if all the birds that
hover on high were to subscribe their wings for quills,
it would be still insufficient to write half the praise and
admiration that are justly due."</p>

of them is that they were impromptu, given
at an evening party.</p>

<h3>PHOTOGRAPHIC CORRESPONDENCE.</h3>

<p><i>Washing or not washing Collodion Pictures after
developing, previous to fixing.</i>&mdash;Since the question
has been mooted I have tried both ways, and have
come to the conclusion that there is very little
difference in the resulting appearance of the picture.
The hypo. is certainly deteriorated when
no washing is adopted. I think it is best to pour
off the first quantity applied into a cup kept for
the purpose; this is discoloured: I then pour on
more clean hypo., and let it remain till the picture
clears, and pour <i>this</i> into another cup or bottle for
future use. What was poured into the first cup
may, when a sufficient quantity is obtained, be
filtered, and by adding more of the salt is not useless.
I pour on merely enough at first to wash off
the developing fluid, and pour it off at once. The
picture is cleared much sooner if the saturated
hypo. solution is warmed, which I do by plunging
the bottle into a pewter pint pot filled with hot
water.</p>

<p class="author">W. M. F.</p>

<p><i>Stereoscopic Angles</i> (Vol. viii., pp. 109. 157.).&mdash;I
perfectly agree with your correspondent <span class="sc">Mr. T.
L. Merritt</span> (p. 109.) respecting "stereoscopic
angles," having arrived at the same conclusion
some months since, while at Hastings, where I
produced stereoscopic pictures by moving the
camera <i>only two inches</i>: having in one, <i>seven</i>
houses and <i>five</i> bathing-machines; and in the
other, <i>five</i> houses and <i>eight</i> bathing-machines. If
I had separated the two pictures more, I should
have had <i>all bathing-machines</i> in one and <i>all houses</i>
in the other; which convinced me that nothing
more is required than the width of the two eyes
for all distances, or, slightly to exaggerate it, to
three inches, which will produce a pleasing and
natural effect: for it is quite certain that our eyes
do not become wider apart as we recede from an
object, and that the intention is to give a true
representation of nature as seen by one person.
Now, most stereoscopic pictures represent nature
as it never could be seen by any one person, from
the same point of view; and I feel confident that
all photographers, who condescend to make stereoscopic
pictures, will arrive at the same conclusion
before the end of this season.</p>

<p>If this be correct, all difficulty is removed; for
it is always advisable to take two pictures of the
same prospect, in case one should not be good:
and two very indifferent negatives will combine
into one very good positive, when viewed by the
stereoscope: thus proving the old saying, that two
negatives make an affirmative.</p>

<p><i>Sisson's Developing Solution.</i>&mdash;In answer to
S. B.'s inquiry, I beg to say, that I have not tried
the above solution as a bath. I have always poured
it on, believing that it was easier to observe the
progress of the picture by that mode. If S. B.
will forward me his address, I shall be happy to
enter more minutely into my mode of operating
with it than I can through the medium of "N.
&amp; Q." I have received other favourable testimony
as to the value of my developing fluid for
glass positives.</p>

<p>While I am writing, will you allow me to ask
your photographic correspondents whether any of
them have tried Mr. Müller's paper process referred
to by Mr. Delamotte at p. 145. of his work?
It was first announced in the <i>Athenæum</i> of Nov. 2,
1851. When I first commenced photography
(June, 1852), I tried the process; and from what
I did with it, when I was almost entirely ignorant
of the manipulation, I am inclined to think it a
valuable process. The sharpness of the tracery in
my church windows, in a picture I took by the
process, is remarkable. Mr. Delamotte truly says:
"This is a most striking discovery, as it supersedes
the necessity of any developing agent after
the light has acted on the paper." Mr. Müller
says, that simple washing in water seems to be
sufficient to fix the picture. This is also a striking
discovery, and totally unlike any other very sensitive
process that I am acquainted with; and more
striking still, that the process should not have been
more practised.</p>

<h2>Replies to Minor Queries.</h2>

<p><i>Robert Drury</i> (Vol. v., p. 533.; Vol. vii., p. 485.;
vol. viii., p. 104.).&mdash;I believe the <i>Journal</i> of Robert
Drury to be a genuine book of travels and
adventures, and here is my voucher:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The best and most authentic account ever given
of Madagascar was published in 1729, by Robert
Drury, who being shipwrecked in the Degrave East
Indiaman, on the south side of that island, in 1702,
being then a boy, lived there as a slave fifteen years,
and after his return to England, among those who
knew him (and he was known to many, being a porter
at the East India House), had the character of a downright
honest man, without any appearance of fraud or
imposture."&mdash;John Duncombe, M. A., one of the six
preachers in Christ Church, Canterbury, 1773.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Mr. Duncombe quotes several statements from
Drury which coincide with those of the Reverend
William Hirst, the astronomer, who touched at
Madagascar, on his voyage to India, in 1759. Ten
years afterwards Mr. Hirst perished in the Aurora,
and with him the author of <i>The Shipwreck</i>.</p>

<p><i>Real Signatures versus Pseudo-Names</i> (Vol. vi.,

that the straightforwardness of open and undisguised
communications to your excellent miscellany<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_182"></a>{182}</span>
is desirable; but a few words may be said on
behalf of your anonymous contributors. If the
rule were established that every correspondent
should add his name to his communication, many
of your friends might, from motives of delicacy,
decline asking a question or hazarding a reply.
By adopting a <i>nom-de-guerre</i>, men eminent in
their various pursuits can quietly and unostentatiously
ask a question, or contribute information.
If the latter be done with reference to standard
works of authority, or to MSS. preserved in our
public depositories, the disclosure of the name of
the contributor adds nothing to the matter contributed,
and he may rejoice that he has been the
means of promoting the objects of the "N. &amp; Q."
without the "blushing to find it fame." It should,
however, be a <i>sine quâ non</i> that all original communications,
and those of matters of fact, should
be authenticated by a real signature, when no reference
can be given to authorities not accessible
to the public; and it is to be regretted that such
authentication has not, in such cases, been generally
afforded.</p>

</div>

<p>May I put a Query on the idea suggested by
these lines&mdash;that the accidental dropping of her
garter implied an imputation on the fair fame of
the Countess of Salisbury. Why should this be?
That it did imply an imputation, I judge as well
from the vindication of the lady by King Edward,
as also from the proverbial expression used in
Scotland, and to be found in Scott's <i>Works</i>, of
"casting a leggin girth," as synonymous with a
female "faux pas." I have a conjecture, but
should not like to venture it, without inquiring
the general impression as to the origin of this
notion.</p>

<p class="author">A. B. R.</p>

<p>Belmont.</p>

<p><i>"Short red, God red," &amp;c.</i> (Vol. vii., p. 500.).&mdash;Sir
Walter Scott has committed an oversight
when, in <i>Tales of a Grandfather</i>, vol. i. p. 85., he
mentions a murderer of the Bishop of Caithness to
have made use of the expression, "Schort red,
God red, slea ye the bischop." Adam, Bishop of
Caithness, was burnt by the mob near Thurso, in
1222, for oppression in the exaction of tithes;
John, Earl of Orkney and Caithness, was killed in
retaliation by the bishop's party in 1231.</p>

<p>The language spoken at that time on the sea-coast
of Caithness must have been Norse. Sutherland
would appear to have been wrested from the
Orkney-Norwegians before that period, and the
Celtic tongue and race gaining on the Norse; but
on the sea-coast of Caithness I should apprehend
the Norse continued to be the spoken tongue till
a later period, when it was superseded by the
Scottish. The Norwegians in the end of the
ninth century colonised Orkney, and expelled or
destroyed the former inhabitants. The Western
Isles were also subjugated by them at that time,
and probably Caithness, or at all events a little
later. It would be desirable to know the race and
tongue previously existing in Caithness, and if
these were lost in the Norwegians and Norse, and
an earlier Christianity in Scandinavian Paganism.
This may, however, lead to the unfathomably dark
subject of the Picts. Is it known when Norse
ceased to be spoken in Caithness? The story of
the burning of the Bishop of Caithness forms the
conclusion of the <i>Orkneyinga Saga</i>; and vide
Torfæus, <i>Orcades</i>, p. 154., and Dalrymple's <i>Annals
of Scotland</i>, of dates 1222 and 1231.</p>

<p><i>Martha Blount</i> (Vol. vii., pp. 38. 117.).&mdash;At

by Sir Godfrey Kneller; and at "Berkeley," also
on the James River, and the residence of another
branch of the same family, is one of the Duchess
of Montagu, also by Kneller. Thus much in answer
to the Query. But in this connexion I would
mention, that on the James River are many fine
pictures, portraits of worthies famous in English
history. At "Shirley" there is one of Col. Hill,
by Vandyke; at Brandon, one of Col. Byrd, by
Vandyke; also Lord Orrery, Duke of Argyle,
Lord Albemarle, Lord Egmont, Sir Robert Walpole,
and others, by Kneller.</p>

<p>These pictures are mentioned in chap. ix. of

to let the readers of "N. &amp; Q." <i>know</i> it also. And
although W. W. thinks it will not be necessary to

me to explain how I fell into the error. It was,
then, from using Mr. Knight's edition of the work
for though the orthography was modernised, which
I like, I never dreamed of an editor's taking the
liberty of altering the text of his author. I love
to be corrected when wrong, and here express my
thanks to B. H. C. I inform him that there is
another passage in Shakspeare with <i>its</i> in it, but
not having marked it, I cannot find it just now: I
think it is in <i>Lear</i>.</p>

<p>I have said that I like modernised orthography.
We have modernised that of the Bible, and of the
dramatists; why then are we so superstitious with
respect to the barbarous system of Spenser? I
am convinced that the <i>Fairy Queen</i>, if printed in
modern orthography, would find many readers who
are repelled by the uncouth and absurd spelling
of the poet, who wanted to rhyme to the eye as
well as to the ear. Let us then have a "Spenser

<p><i>Dutch Pottery</i> (Vol. v., p. 343.; Vol. vi. p. 253.).&mdash;At
Arnhem, about sixty-five or seventy years
ago, there existed a pottery founded by two Germans:
H. Brandeis, and the well-known savant
H. von Laun, maker of the planetarium (orrery)
described by Professor van Swinden, and purchased
by the Society <i>Felix Meritis</i> in Amsterdam.
The son of Mr. Brandeis has still at his residence,
No. 419. Rapenburgerstraat, several articles manufactured
there: such as plates, &amp;c. What I have
seen is much coarser than the Saxon porcelain,
yet much better than our Delft ware. Perhaps
Mr. Van Embden, grandson and successor of Von
Laun, could give farther information.</p>

<p><i>Portable Altars</i> (Vol. viii., p. 101.).&mdash;I am not

<p><i>Poem attributed to Shelley</i> (Vol. viii., p. 71.).&mdash;The
ridiculous extravaganza attributed to Shelley
by an American newspaper, was undoubtedly
never written by that gifted genius. It bears
throughout unmistakeable evidence of its transatlantic
origin. No person, who had not actually
witnessed that curious vegetable parasite, the
<i>Spanish moss</i> of the southern states of America,
hanging down in long, hairy-like plumes from the
branches of a large tree, would have imagined the
lines,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
  <div class="stanza">
    <p>"The downy clouds droop</p>

<p>Who, again, could believe that Shelley, an English
gentleman and scholar, could ever, either in
writing or conversation, have made use of the
common American vulgarism, "play hell!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_184"></a>{184}</span></p>

<p>The question of the authorship of such a production,
apart from its being attributed to Shelley,
is, in my humble opinion, a matter of little or no
interest. But as a probable guess, I should say
that it carries strong internal evidence of having
been written by that erratic mortal, Edgar Poe.</p>

<p><i>Lady Percy, Wife of Hotspur (Daughter of
Edmumd Mortimer, Earl of March)</i> (Vol. viii.,
p. 104.).&mdash;On reference to the volume and page
of Miss Strickland's <i>Lives of the Queens of England</i>,
cited by your correspondent G., I find that
not only does this lady, by her sweeping assertion,
bastardise the second E. of Northumberland, but,
in her zeal to outsay all that "ancient heralds"
ever can have said, she annihilates, or at least
reduces to a myth, the mother of Thomas, eighth
Lord Clifford. This infelicitous statement may
have been corrected in the second edition of the
<i>Lives</i>, for in "N. &amp; Q.," Vol. vii., p. 42., there is
a detailed pedigree tracing the descent of Jane
Seymour through Margaret Wentworth, her mother,
by an intermarriage with a Wentworth, and
a <i>granddaughter</i> of Hotspur, Lord Percy, (not
<i>daughter</i>, as Miss Strickland writes) from the
blood-royal of England. My object, however, in
writing this is not farther to point attention to
Miss Strickland's mistake, but to invite discussion
to the point where this pedigree may be possibly
faulty. I will not say "all ancient heralds," but
some heralds, at least, of acknowledged reputation,
viz. Nicolas, Collins, and Dugdale<a name="footnotetag6" href="#footnote6"><sup>[6]</sup></a>, have stated
that the wife of Sir Philip Wentworth was a
daughter of Roger fifth Lord Clifford. If this be
so, in truth there is an end at once of the Seymour's
claim to royal lineage; for it is an undoubted
fact that it was the grandson of Roger
fifth Lord, namely, John, seventh Lord Clifford,
K.G., who married Hotspur's only daughter.</p>

<p>"<i>Up, guards, and at them!</i>" (Vol. v., p. 426.;
Vol. viii., p. 111.).&mdash;Some years ago, about the
time that the Wellington statue on the arch at
Hyde Park Corner was erected, I was dining at a
table where Wyatt the artist was present. The
conversation turned much upon the statue, and
the exact period at which the great Duke is represented.
Wyatt said that he was represented at
that moment when he is supposed to have used
the words: "Up, guards, and at them!" It having
been questioned whether he ever uttered the
words, I asked the artist whether, when he was
taking the Duke's portrait, the Duke himself
acknowledged using them? To which he replied,
that the Duke said that he did not recollect having
uttered those words and, in fact, that he could
not say what expression he did use on that occasion.
The company at dinner seemed much satisfied
with Wyatt's authority on this point.</p>

<p><i>Pennycomequick</i> (Vol. viii., p. 113.).&mdash;A similar
story to that related by your correspondent <span class="sc">Mr.
Hele</span> is told of Falmouth. Previously to its being
incorporated as a town by Charles II., it was called
<i>Smithick</i>, from a smith's shop, near a <i>creek</i>, which
extended up the valley. The old Cornish word
<i>ick</i> signifies a "creek;" and as it became a village it
was called "Pennycomequick," which your correspondent
H. C. K. clearly explains. The Welsh
and Cornish languages are in close affinity. The
name "Pennycomequick" is evidently a corrupted
old Cornish name: see Pryce's <i>Archæologia Cornu-Britannica</i>,
v. "Pen," "Coomb," and "Ick," the
head of the narrow valley, defile or creek. It has
been thought by some to mean "the head of the
cuckoo's valley;" and your correspondent's Welsh
derivation seems to countenance such a translation.
The cuckoo is known in Scotland, Wales, and
Cornwall as "the <i>Gawk</i> Gwich." <span class="sc">Mr. Hele</span>,
perhaps, will be amused at the traditional story
of the Falmouthians respecting the origin of
Pennycomequick. Before the year 1600, there
were few houses on the site of the present town:
a woman, who had been a servant with an ancestor
of the late honourable member for West Cornwall,
Mr. Pindarves, came to reside there, and that
gentleman directed her to brew some good ale, as
he should occasionally visit the place with his
friends. On one of his visits he was disappointed,
and expressed himself angry at not finding any ale.
It appeared on explanation that a Dutch vessel
came into the harbour the preceding day, and the
Dutchmen drained her supply; she said the <i>Penny
come so quick</i>, she could not refuse to sell it.</p>

<p><i>Captain Booth of Stockport</i> (Vol. viii., p. 102.).&mdash;In
answer to <span class="sc">Mr. Hughes's</span> inquiry about this
antiquary, I beg to state that he will find an
<i>Ordinary of Arms</i>, drawn up by Captain Booth
of Stockport, in the Shepherd Library, Preston,
Lancashire. It is one among the numerous valuable
MSS. given by the executors of the late
historian of Lancashire, Ed. Baines, Esq., M.P.,
to that library. In Lysons' <i>Magna Britannia</i>
(volume Cheshire), your correspondent will also
find a mention of a John Booth, Esq., of Twemlow,
Cheshire, who was the author of various heraldic
manuscripts. It may, perhaps, be hardly necessary
to inform Cheshire antiquaries that an almost
inexhaustible fund of information, on heraldry and
genealogy, is to be found in the manuscripts of
Randle Holme, formerly of Chester, which are<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_185"></a>{185}</span>
now preserved among the Harleian MSS. in the

<p><i>"Hurrah," &amp;c.</i> (Vol. viii., p. 20.).&mdash;The <i>clameur
de Haro</i> still exists in Jersey, and is the ancient
form there of opposing all encroachments on
landed property, and the first step to be taken by
which an ejectment can be finally obtained. It
was decided in Pinel and Le Gallais, that the
<i>clameur de Haro</i> does not apply to the opposal of
the execution of a decree of the Royal Court.</p>

<p>It is a remarkable feature in this process, that
it is carried on by the crown; and that the losing
party, whether plaintiff or defendant, is mulcted
in a small fine to the king, because the sacred
name of <i>Haro</i> is not to be carelessly invoked with
impunity.</p>

<p>See upon the subject of the <i>clameur</i>, <i>Le Geyt

<p>I do not think that the explanation of these
words, quoted by <span class="sc">Mr. Brent</span>, is much more probable
than that of "Hierosolyma est perdita." In
the first place, if we are to believe Dr. Johnson,
<i>hips</i> are not <i>sloes</i>, but the fruit or seed-vessels of
the dog-rose or briar, which usually go by that
name, and from which it would be difficult to
make any infusion resembling wine. In the next
place, it will be found, on reference to Ben Jonson's
lines "over the door at the entrance into the
Apollo" (vol. vii. p. 295., ed. 1756), of which the
distich forms a part, that it is misquoted. The
words are,&mdash;</p>

<p>the hop or ale-drinkers being contrasted with the
votaries of wine, "the milk of Venus," and "the
true Phœbeian liquor." Is it not possible, after
all, that the repetition of, "Hip, hip, hip," is
merely intended to mark the time for the grand
exertion of the lungs to be made in enunciating
the final "Hurrah!"?</p>

<p><i>Detached Belfry Towers</i> (Vol. vii., p. 333.;
Vol. viii., p. 63.).&mdash;The bell-tower at Hackney,
mentioned by B. H. C., is that of the old parish
church of St. Augustine. This church was rebuilt
in the early part of the sixteenth century, which
is about the time of the present tower; and when
the church was finally taken down in 1798, the
tower was forced to be left standing, because the
new parish church of St. John-at-Hackney was
not strong enough to support the peal of eight
bells.</p>

<p><i>Blotting-paper</i> (Vol. viii., p. 104.).&mdash;I am disposed
to agree with <span class="sc">Speriend</span> in thinking Carlyle
must be mistaken in saying this substance was not
used in Cromwell's time. The ordinary means for
drying writing was by means of the fine silver
sand, now but rarely used for that purpose; but
I have seen pieces of blotting-paper among MSS.
of the time of Charles I., so as to lead me to think
it was even then used, though sparingly. This is
only conjecture; but I can, however, establish its
existence at a rather earlier date than 1670. In
an "Account of Stationery supplied to the Receipt
of the Exchequer and the Treasury, 1666-1668,"
occur several entries of "one quire of blotting-paper,"
"two quires of blotting," &amp;c. Earlier
accounts of the same kind (which may be at the
Rolls House, Chancery Lane) might enable one to
fix the date of its introduction.</p>

<p>"Let the dusting or sanding of presidents in books
be avoided, rather using <i>fine brown paper to prevent blotting</i>,
if time of the ink's drying cannot be allowed; for
sand takes away the good colour of the ink, and getting
into the backs of books makes them break their
binding."</p>

</blockquote>

<p>From this passage it may be inferred, that fine
brown paper, to prevent blotting, was then rather
a novelty.</p>

<h3>NOTES ON BOOKS, ETC.</h3>

<p>Although, like Canning's knife-grinder, we do not
care to meddle with politics, we have one volume on
our table belonging to that department of life which
deserves passing mention, we mean Mr. Urquhart's
<i>Progress of Russia in the West, North, and South, by
opening the Sources of Opinion, and appropriating the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_186"></a>{186}</span>
Channels of Wealth and Power</i>, which those who differ
most widely from Mr. Urquhart will probably deem
worth reading at a moment when all eyes are turned
towards St. Petersburgh. It is of course a knowledge
of the great interest everywhere felt in the Russian-Turkish
question, which has induced Messrs. Longman
to reprint in their <i>Traveller's Library</i>, in a separate
form and with additions, <i>Turkey and Christendom, an
Historical Sketch of the Relations between the Ottoman
Empire and the States of Europe</i>.</p>

<p>The Rev. R. W. Eyton announces for publication
by subscription <i>Antiquities of Shropshire</i>, which is intended
to contain such accessible materials as may
serve to illustrate the history of the county during the
first two centuries after the Norman Conquest, though
that period is not proposed as an invariable limit. The
preface to the first Number will give an account of the
public authorities which the author has consulted, as
well as of the materials which have been supplied or
promised by the kindness of individuals. Each Number
will contain six sheets (96 pages), and will be accompanied
by maps or illustrations referable to the period.
Each fourth Number will include an Index. The
first part will be put to press as soon as 200 Subscribers
are obtained, and the number of copies printed will be
limited to those originally subscribed for.</p>

<p>We are again indebted to Mr. Bohn for several
valuable additions to our stores of cheap literature. In
his <i>Standard Library</i> he has published two volumes of
<i>Lectures delivered at Broadmead Chapel, Bristol, by the
late John Foster</i>. In his <i>Antiquarian Library</i> he has
given us the second volume of <i>Matthew of Westminster's
Flowers of History</i>, translated by C. D. Yonge, who
has added a short but very useful Index: while in his
<i>Classical Library</i> we have the first volume of <i>The
Comedies of Aristophanes: a New and Literal Translation
from the revised Text of Dindorf, with Notes and
Extracts from the best Metrical Versions</i>, by W. J. Hickie.
The present volume contains The Acharnians, Knights,
Clouds, Wasps, Peace, and Birds.</p>

<p>"This light and pleasant Farina is one of the
most excellent, nourishing and restorative
remedies, and supersedes, in many cases, all
kinds of medicines. It is particularly useful
in confined habit of body, as also diarrhœa,
bowel complaints, affections of the kidneys and
bladder, such as stone or gravel; inflammatory
irritation and cramp of the urethra, cramp of
the kidneys and bladder, strictures, and hemorrhoids.
This really invaluable remedy is employed
with the most satisfactory result, not
only in bronchial and pulmonary complaints,
where irritation and pain are to be removed,
but also in pulmonary and bronchial consumption,
in which it counteracts effectually the
troublesome cough; and I am enabled with
perfect truth to express the conviction that Du
Barry's Revalenta Arabica is adapted to the
cure of incipient hectic complaints and consumption.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright

States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG&#8482;
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away--you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected
by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the trademark
license, especially commercial redistribution.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.
</div>

<div style='display:block; font-size:1.1em; margin:1em 0; font-weight:bold'>
Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work (any work
on which the phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; appears, or with which the
phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms
    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you
    are not located in the United States, you will have to check the laws
    of the country where you are located before using this eBook.
  </div>
</blockquote>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg&#8482;
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg&#8482; License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg&#8482;
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg&#8482;.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; License.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,

unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
provided that:
</div>

<div style='margin-left:0.7em;'>
    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &bull; You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
        legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
        payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
        Section 4, &#8220;Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
        Literary Archive Foundation.&#8221;

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &bull; You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
        you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
        does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg&#8482;
        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
        works.
    </div>

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &bull; You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
        any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
        electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
        receipt of the work.
    </div>

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &bull; You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
        distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works.
    </div>
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the manager of
the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark. Contact the Foundation as set
forth in Section 3 below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you &#8216;AS-IS&#8217;, WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search

Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
